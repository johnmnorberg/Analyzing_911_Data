# Analyzing 911 Data

I spent nearly seven years in the 911 industry answering non-emergency and 911 phone calls, as well as dispatching law, fire, and EMS to calls for service across seven counties in Washington and Idaho. Prior to leaving 911, I made a public records request so I could practice skills I was learning in my masters program and to dive deeper into my own analytical projects.

* Simulation: Analyzing/simulating scheduling using phone call data in Python (work-in-progress)
* Poisson and Negative Binomial Regression: a final project for a Bayesian statistics class that uses Bayesian and frequentist regression methods in R
